### What is this repository for? ###

Product Perspective
The weather app will be used on low-powered Android devices with very small non-touch screens not above
three inches diagonally. All navigation in the app will be done via a four-way directional D-pad with center
button, two software-configurable soft-keys on either side, and a T9 text entry keyboard using a number pad
for physical input.
Features
There will be four main features in the weather app – current weather conditions, an hourly forecast for the
next twelve or more hours, a multi-day daily future weather forecast, and a static radar map image displaying
current rain conditions across the user’s region.
• Current weather conditions will be a display of current cloud-cover using terms like sunny, partly
sunny, cloudy, etc. It will also show current temperature, the predicted maximum and minimum
temperatures for the day, the chance of precipitation. It may also include the predicted conditions
for the next hour.
• Hourly forecast shall display the following data points for a minimum of the next 12 hours (predicted
cloud-cover, predicted temperature, predicted chance of precipitation). If the API used to source the
weather data supports it, the hourly forecast shall display the next 24 hours.
• Multi-day forecast shall display the following data points for at least the next five days (predicted
cloud-cover, predicted chance of precipitation, predicted minimum temperature, and predicted 
maximum temperature). If the API used to source the weather data supports it, the daily forecast
shall display data for the next seven days.
• Radar map image will display a graphic showing current precipitation conditions across the user’s
local region. The radar graphic should animate with frames showing previous conditions for at least
the last four hours. The image should allow for panning via the four-way D-pad keys and zooming in
and out. The default zoom level will be approximately 50 miles.
